### Auto_LV_endocardium_segmentation (MSCV1 project work)

The goal of this project work was to develop an automatic system for Left Ventricles segmentation from a cardiac MRI ( in NIFTI ) in order t estimate the Cavity volume and mass of the LV.

* The method been adopted involves k-means with graph search algorithm 
* Data set is gotten from the [MICCAI challenge 2017 website](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/)
* read through the pdf repot of project work for the description of the implementation and operation of the software.
